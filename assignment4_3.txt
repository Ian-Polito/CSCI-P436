Assignment 4.3 Report

This assignment is where I implemented the FUTURE_SHARED and FUTURE_QUEUE modes for the already
established future program from Assignment 4.1. Running future_test with xsh_run now offers a
few new flags, such as -pc which tests the producer/consumer case with all three modes. In
addition, using the -f flag along with a number will use the future program to calculate the
nth fibonacci number by creating n+1 processes running ffib().
